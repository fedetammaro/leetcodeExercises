# Why Leetcode?
I'm doing some exercises to keep my logic and algorithmic approach sharp, and I'm doing them using Python which is not my main programming language.
I'll try to do at least one exercise a week (not to set the bar too high!) and post a complete recap of how I approached the problem and designed the solution.

I will not push for a perfect solution in terms of complexity or memory, as the site pushes you for, but I'll try to optimize what I can, creating several versions of the same problem's solution.

You can find my Leetcode profile [here](https://leetcode.com/u/Sfullez/), and I suggest you to try the exercises proposed by the site to have som fun!
